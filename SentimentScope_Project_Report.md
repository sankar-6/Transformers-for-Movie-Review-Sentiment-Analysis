# üìù Project Report: SentimentScope ‚Äì Sentiment Analysis using Transformers

## Objective
The goal of this project was to build and train a **Transformer-based model from scratch** using **PyTorch** to perform **binary sentiment classification** on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The model predicts whether a review expresses a *positive* or *negative* sentiment.

---

## Approach
- Loaded and preprocessed the **IMDB dataset** into training, validation, and test sets.  
- Implemented a **custom PyTorch Dataset** class (`IMDBDataset`) to tokenize text data and prepare it for batching.  
- Built a custom **Transformer architecture (`DemoGPT`)** including:
  - Token and positional embeddings  
  - Multi-head self-attention  
  - Feed-forward layers  
  - Layer normalization and dropout for stability  
  - A **classification head** for binary output  
- Trained the model using **AdamW optimizer** and **CrossEntropyLoss**.  
- Evaluated model performance on validation and test sets using an accuracy metric.

## Results
| Dataset | Accuracy |
|----------|-----------|
| Training | 83.7% |
| Validation | 77.88% |
| Test | 77.36% |

The model successfully learned to classify review sentiment and achieved **>75% accuracy on unseen data**, meeting the project‚Äôs expected benchmark.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Transformers can effectively capture contextual meaning** in text even without pretraining, thanks to self-attention, which allows the model to weigh relationships between words in a sentence.  
2. **Model design and hyperparameter tuning** (like number of layers, learning rate, and batch size) significantly impact model accuracy and generalization performance.  
3. Building a transformer **from scratch in PyTorch** deepens understanding of how architectures like GPT and BERT function internally ‚Äî including attention heads, feed-forward blocks, and positional encodings.  
4. Using **mean pooling for sentence-level representations** is a simple yet effective strategy for text classification tasks.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tune a **pre-trained model (like BERT or DistilBERT)** to further boost accuracy.  
- Incorporate **early stopping** and **learning rate scheduling** to optimize training.  
- Experiment with **larger datasets** or **multi-class sentiment analysis** (e.g., positive/neutral/negative).
